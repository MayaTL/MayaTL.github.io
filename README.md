Assignment 1: Your Online Portfolio

1A - Aspects of the work that have been correctly implemented:
	I ran index.html, bio.html, and resume.html through the online HTML validator, and have corrected all errors and warnings received, such that the validator now returns the message "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

1B - Aspects of the work that have been incorrectly implemented:
	Nothing to my knowledge has been incorrectly implemented.

2  - I didn't collaborate with anyone or discuss the assignment with anyone. When I was stuck and/or uncertain, I mostly used the resources made available via links on the COMP 20 page, as well as sites like stackoverflow for advice on addressing errors and warnings that came up when using the HTML and CSS validators.

3  - I have spent about 6 hours completing this assignment
