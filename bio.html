	<p>I refuse to imprison myself with the notion that the world is simple. The complexity of the universe demands questions, and diversity demands discussion. People are necessarily interdependent, and the resulting societal structures of different peoples fascinate me. It has not only inspired my passion for social justice, but also my passion for the brain. The brain is the common link and most important differentiator between humans. After my first seminar on the brain, twelve year old me began telling everyone that I loved him or her from the bottom of my amygdala. In the second one, a year later, I was so excited to dissect my first brain that I took two. By the end of the workshop, I knew that I wanted to study the brain.</p>

	<p>The puzzle of the puzzle solver continues to entice me. After reading The Future of the Mind by Michio Kaku fours years ago, I realized the brain is truly the last frontier. It sparks my insatiable curiosity, and fuels my desire to earn my PhD and become a leading researcher in Neuroengineering, a discipline within the field of Biomedical Engineering.</p>

	<div id="box-two">
		<blockquote>To best prepare me for Neuroengineering, I have meticulously designed my academic career to incorporate knowledge and skills of Medical Devices, Biological Systems, Tissue Engineering, Computational Neuroscience, and Computer Engineering. </blockquote>
	</div>

	<p>As someone who has been captivated by the function of both healthy and diseased brains, I am constantly perusing new scientific literature pertaining to the brain, the mind, artificial intelligence, and how all of these fields intersect. I’m eager to better understand the realities of how the brain functions versus what students learn in the classroom. I value the non-linearity of research. There is no direct path to some “correct” answer. Experimenting, failing, and learning is arguably the most important aspect to research, with curiosity as a close contender</p>

	<div id="box-three">
		<blockquote>Curiosity may have killed the cat but it is the drive that keeps me eager to learn</blockquote>
	</div>
	

	<p>This drive has developed unparalleled work ethic within me. Based on feedback given to me by supervisors at my previous jobs, my intellectual acuity enables me to swiftly acquire new skills. As an engineering student at Tufts, which focuses on teaching students about cutting-edge research, I’m very comfortable with reading and analyzing scientific literature. Furthermore, I have practice designing experiments. For my final project in Biomaterials and Regenerative Medicine, I put together a research proposal on engineering bovine dermal cells for the production of leather. My programming abilities also supply an extra edge in conducting experiments; whilst my knowledge of medical imaging permits me to interpret brain scans; and my coding combined with my statistical skills enables me to effectively analyze data. Facing a problem, I balance working to solve it myself with the value of advice. Excited about the prospect of working on a research team, I am a student, who does not shy away from rigorous work, and who can be trusted to carry out given instructions. Moreover because my interests are so far reaching, I’ve developed impressive scientific communication skills from my exposure to a wide range of scientific and engineering fields. </p>
	<div id="box-four">
		<blockquote>I am certain my academic career thus far has prepared me to excel in any industry or research opportunity.</blockquote>
	</div>

	<p>With a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the human brain, I aim to one day create a brain machine interface that enhances cognition; is powered by the human body; and continuously updates, as the technology familiarizes itself with brain connectivity. My goals are lofty, but I believe in science, I believe in the opportunity you offer, and I believe in me. I intend to one day expand the ever-diminishing horizons of science and of humanity. 
	</p>

	<div id="box-five">
		<blockquote>My passion ensures no task is too insignificant in living out this goal; my intellectual curiosity ensures no challenge is too great.</blockquote>
